## TIAM+ classifier

From this directory, typing the command `python tiam.py -h` will
display information about this utility.

### TODO

- The performance of the classifiers is checked under 10-fold
  cross-validation, but the classifiers are not built with
  cross-validation. This needs to be fixed
  
- Running `python tiam.py classify` still doesn't quite do what it needs to

- I need to write documentation
